Hey there! I’m Arbaz Khan, a passionate full-stack developer, mobile app creator, game development enthusiast, and currently a BSc Computer Science student at the University of Central Punjab. This blog is a window into my journey — how I started, what I’ve built, and where I’m headed.

 🚀 A Developer with a Creative Twist
From the day I wrote my first “Hello World,” I knew I wanted to build more than just code — I wanted to create solutions. Over the years, I’ve worked on several projects ranging from mobile apps to games to full-stack web platforms. One of my favorite creations is a calculator app that mimics the iPhone's interface — simple yet elegant, built using Android Studio.

But my creativity didn’t stop there. I developed an app that monitors the smog quality index and alerts users when air quality becomes harmful. It’s my way of combining code with care — building something useful for real people in real situations.

 🧠 Not Just Technical — I Sell Ideas
What sets me apart is that I don’t just write code — I know how to present, sell, and communicate ideas. I’ve always been fascinated by the psychology behind decision-making, which led me to hone strong sales and persuasion skills. I can walk into a room and pitch a product with the same confidence I have when pushing commits to GitHub. This ability to merge logic with empathy gives me an edge — whether I’m explaining a project, leading a team, or building user-centered applications.

 🔧 My Toolkit
I’ve gained hands-on experience in:

- Android Development with Java/Kotlin
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js)
- Game Development using Unity
- Machine Learning (built a housing price prediction model using Python)
- Networking & Security (designed VLAN-based networks and ACLs using Cisco Packet Tracer)

From creating Pushdown Automata in Theory of Automata to simulating complex routing protocols like RIP and OSPF, I’ve never shied away from technical depth. I love solving challenging problems — whether in code, logic, or communication.

 📈 Where I’m Headed
Right now, I’m focusing on expanding my skills in AI, cloud technologies, and software architecture. I’m also actively working on improving my personal brand — I’ve built my portfolio website, where I showcase everything I’ve done and everything I’m learning. It's not just a collection of projects — it's a reflection of my growth and mindset.

I believe the future belongs to those who can build and connect — and that’s the space I’m aiming to master. Whether it's launching a startup, joining an innovative team, or mentoring others, I’m here to leave an impact — one line of code at a time.
